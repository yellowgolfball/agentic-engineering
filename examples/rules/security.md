# Security Rules

- IMPORTANT: never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Use obviously fake placeholders in docs, tests, and examples
- Treat inbound traffic as untrusted by default
- Avoid logging sensitive payloads unless explicitly required
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
